# HTMLCSSJSWeb-ProjectBandB
A college project whilst on my Higher Diploma in Science in Computing course (2016/17).  This college project  is a pure HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript mock up of a website without the use of any frameworks like Bootstrap, Ionic, Angular(2), etc. Its challenge was getting the visual design correct looking on a laptop or normal desktop without using responsive design techniques. All design features including logos are my own. It was a fun design project to do!
